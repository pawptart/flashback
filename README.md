# flashback

Flashback is built in React as a part of a project for Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp

Flashback is a single page webapp designed to represent a stack of flash cards. It uses static flash card data to render a pile of flash cards for study.

## TODO 

* Fix bug with Heroku deployment
* Add ability to create new flash cards?
